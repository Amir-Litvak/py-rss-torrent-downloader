# RSS torrent downloader
A WIP application for downloading and automating torrent downloads from RSS feeds, specifically for the QBitorrent client.
What started out a a simple script to automate rss feed downloads, is turning into an application
that uses the newly formed API for the downloader, with Telegram messaging support and much more. 

#### Uses the feedparer, qbitorrent, and telegram modules.

#### This is a work in progress!
